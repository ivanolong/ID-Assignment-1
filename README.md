ID Assignment 1 Portfolio Website
This is a website to present who I am, what I have done/achieved to show employers what I am capable of. Essentially what this website's purpose is to flaunt my capabilities to appeal to potential employers.

Design Process
I wanted a slick design with the default UI bar at the top. A dark yet eye-catching website for employers to take notice. The website will be suitable for any future employees looking for an entry job and everything in this website ranging from the font to the colouring and UI to promote themselves.

Let's say a user wants to contact the person of interest in the portfolio website, the following prototype below will show how it is done: https://xd.adobe.com/view/0f3abe47-52d7-4a97-9866-e20efc5a3d75-5a69/?fullscreen&hints=off

Features
The settings button on the right hand side of the screen allows you to change the colour of the website to your liking so that some special words will change colour.
The UI bar at the top will navigate you through the website
There will be an arrow at the bottom right when you reach the end of the website to bring you back up to the top

Existing Features
Feature 1 - You can fill in the contact me form and send a message.

Features Left to Implement
The buttons to actually work and take you to more information on the works.
Technologies Used
HTML(https://html.com/) To code the layout and link everything else of the website
CSS(https://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/Overview.en.html) To give the website more of the wow factor and customised to my own liking.
JavaScript(https://www.javascript.com/) To give the website some functionality.
Adobe XD(https://www.adobe.com/sg/products/xd.html) To do wireframe works.

Bugs
The hamburger menu is supposed to show the navigation bar on the phone version but it does not pop up for some reason.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.
On both the phone and pc website, the layout is the same and still a scrolling website while the only difference is the website will scale to fit the phone but still have the proper layout.
